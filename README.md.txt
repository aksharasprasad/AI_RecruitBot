# AI RecruitBot – Granite-Powered HR Assistant

**AI RecruitBot** is an intelligent resume screening assistant powered by IBM Granite models. It automates the process of evaluating resumes, providing summaries, match scores, and recommendations to help recruiters make faster, smarter hiring decisions.

## 💡 Problem Statement
Recruiters waste valuable time manually scanning hundreds of resumes for each job opening. This process is inefficient, subjective, and error-prone.

## ✅ Solution
AI RecruitBot takes a resume and a target job title as input, analyzes the content using IBM Granite (mocked here for demonstration), and generates:
- A candidate summary
- A match score
- A shortlist recommendation

This helps HR teams save time and make consistent, AI-backed decisions.

## 🛠️ How It Works
- `sample_resume.txt` contains the resume input.
- `recruitbot.py` reads the resume, simulates analysis via IBM Granite, and prints results.
